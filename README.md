Tkinter classes and methods

This simple tables class, creates a frame that can be added to any grid or root window in tkinter
It returns a frame. 
The only thing you have to feed it is a root window or frame from tkinter and a csv file
and it will return a frame with your table on.

The tables class will work out the length of each field by checking every item in the file.
